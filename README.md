# Credit-Default-Prediction
Credit Default Prediction is a Kaggle competition from American Express. The objective of this competition was to build a model to predict credit default by using customers' data. The dataset contains 5.5M+ data with 189 features and a lot of missing data. Since there was no information about explanatory variables, I applied a variety of feature engineering techniques to create significant features. I finished this competition in the top 5% among 4,874 teams on the public leaderboard.
